For this assignment, I took the instructions literally. It asks - *Use a loop to display the list of available products to the user and **add functionality for users** to add products to their cart.*

In order to accomplish this I had to do some research as to how I could have the user interact with the program via the command line. In python it's quite simple, however with javaScript we have to
import readline and setup an interface for the userinput. Lines 1, and 18-21 contain this code, and the promptUser Function is where the actual functionality lives.
